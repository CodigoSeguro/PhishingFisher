For the chrome-extension you will need to add it manually to your browser, go here inside your browser chrome://extensions/ and then check "Developer mode" and load it by clicking "Load unpacked extensions...".
  
## Usage
In the website you just need to introduce the website you want to check and in the case that it doesn't have this site stored it will save it so it can check it afterwards.
In the chrome-extension you can click on it when you see a website and you doubt about it. It will store the site and check it later if it is not stored in the database.
